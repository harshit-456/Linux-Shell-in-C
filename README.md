# Linux-Shell-in-C
 ##Implemented a command line interpreter (or a shell). 
 The shell  operates in this basic way: when we type in a command (in response to 
its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command we 
entered and then prompts for more user input when the child has finished. 

The  shell can be run in two ways: interactive and batch.
The shell supports commands and redirection and other features of Typical linux shell.
